# College Schedule and To-Do List

This personal HTML webpage project of mine gives insight into keeping track of my college schedule, assignments, and study goals. It was designed to keep everything in one place concerning classes and facilitate the process of staying on top of daily and weekly tasks easily. Having my course list, class schedule, and to-do items all in one place allows me to focus more on my studies and spend less time worrying about what needs to be done.

# Here's how I've organized the page:

* Course Listing: This is only a quick-reference section where I will list down all the courses I am currently taking. It's small, yet it is helpful in reminding myself of what subjects I'm taking each semester, mostly when I go on to plan my study sessions or check assignments.
* Daily Class Schedule: I have listed here the days of the week and the classes that I have each day, so that I may see how my whole day will go and get prepared for each class in advance. It works great for planning study time around classes.
* To-do list: The broad habits and/or reminders to go out and exercise, drink enough water, and use my time wisely. It is a simple list of things, but it keeps me focused and disciplined when life gets busy.
* Study Goals: That is where I go specific, stating what I want to achieve in each subject. I break down what I need to work on for each class: assignments, self-study tasks, lecture reviews. Having these in front of me helps in prioritizing work so that I always know what's next in each subject.

Overall, this webpage is a convenient all-in-one planner for my college life. Having everything in one place allows me instantly to determine my schedule, what needs to be done, and if I am maintaining the pace of each course in this format. Very simple setup, but it makes quite a difference in helping me stay organized and productive.
