### Main Concepts I Applied:
1. I created an ordered list of five highlighted events at the college, using **bold text** to make each event stand out. 
2. Within these highlighted events, I created a nested unordered list to provide detailed information about each event. I used **bold text** for the headings—Venue, Date, and Time—while the specific details were presented in regular text underneath.

### What I Learned:
I learned how to apply CSS to style lists effectively. I also discovered how to create a nested unordered list, which helped me organize information clearly. Additionally, I learned how to style a `<div>` container, such as applying a background color to enhance the overall visual appeal.

### Challenges I Faced:
Initially, I found it challenging to remember and utilize the various attributes in CSS. It felt overwhelming at first, but I overcame this by dedicating time to learn different attributes and their purposes. Whenever I wanted to use a specific attribute, I would review my notes to refresh my memory, which helped reinforce my understanding over time.
