This project serves as a compilation of college events scheduled for the current semester. It is not designed for public use, as it is a task assigned by my module tutor and is not an official website for the college. While the information and details provided for each event are accurate, this project is intended solely for educational purposes and personal learning. It acts as a simple representation of how event information can be organized and displayed, rather than functioning as an official notice board for the college.
