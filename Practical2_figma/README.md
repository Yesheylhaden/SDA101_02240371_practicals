## Food delivery in Figma.
https://www.figma.com/design/Hwzhpdl5Ws3UcZQGoSmjpk/Untitled?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=h1gglQN847WKKtzo-1

## Project Overview:

I designed a food delivery website in Figma for this project. I implemented the design concepts we learned in class to bring in my skills and capabilities. My aim was to create an easy user interface, keeping in mind the layout, navigation, and overall user experience of having a smooth food delivery service.This project allowed me to test and refine my skills in design and prototyping within Figma.

Alternatively, you can use Figma directly in your browser without installing anything by visiting [https://www.figma.com/](https://www.figma.com/).

## Usage:

To access Figma, the user logs in at [figma.com](https://figma.com) and opens the designated file from their dashboard. Once open, they can interact with the design, make edits, experiment with inputs, and preview the results in real time to iterate and refine the design.

## Features:

1. **Design and Code Handoff**: Figma reduces the efforts involved in handoff by providing code snippets, CSS properties, and the facility for direct export of design assets for developers.

2. **Layout**: The intuitive layout system of Figma makes it easy to compose responsive designs capable of adapting to screen size automatically.

3. **Component and Asset Libraries**: Designers can create reusable components, such as buttons and icons, store them in libraries so that consistency in design is kept across the project.

4. **Prototyping**: This is an interaction design capability in Figma that allows for the creation of interactive prototypes, adding animation and transitions to simulate how a final product would interact in action.

## Technologies Used:

1. Auto Layout.
2. Frames.
3. PEN Tools.
4. Text Styles.
5. Prototyping.

## Acknowledgement:

Hands-on experience such as this has indeed been invaluable in the development of my creative thinking and in increasing my level of confidence. Practical opportunities have provided a chance to implement what I learned into practice, think innovatively, and improve problem-solving ability. The commitment of my tutor in securing relevant and appropriate real-world learning experiences is valued most. Their effort has touched me in such a way that I have started pushing my limits, looking into new ideas, and understanding the importance of practical knowledge in shaping my future. This approach really motivates me to strive for improvements on a continuous basis and welcome challenges with an open mind.
