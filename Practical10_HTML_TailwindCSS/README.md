## Assignment Question:
1. Create a table to display job listings with the following columns: Job Title, Company,   Location, and Application Deadline.

2. Create a simple photo ghallery using grid display.

3. Design a navigation bar for a college website using flex layout.

### Exercise
4. Create a simple webpage with a micro interaction using TailwindCSS and ensure it's fully responsive.

## Steps:

Create HTML elements for the main content, such as a container, header, and footer.
Style these elements using TailwindCSS classes to establish a basic layout.
Choose a micro interaction effect (e.g., hover animation for a button - changes color or size)
Utilize TailwindCSS's responsive modifiers (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:) to adjust styles based on screen size.
Test your website on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it adapts properly.

## Project Overview:

The following pages represent a collection of HTML pages for use on a fictional "College of Science and Technology" website. The purpose of this is to give an overview of basic web layout and styling that could be used on a college website. This ranges in scope from navigation and job postings to photo galleries and a responsive landing page complete with micro-interactions. These are files meant to be used for educational use, not an actual, functioning official website.

## Technologies Used:

- **HTML5** for page structure
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox** for responsive design
- **Responsive Design Principles** for mobile, tablet, and desktop views

## Files and Structure:

- `index.html`: Main landing page with navigation, hero section, and listings of jobs.
- **`gallery.html`**: A photo gallery page that displays a grid of photos.
- **`nav.html`: It gives the different navigation bar, basically a set of quick links for the college website sections.
- **`interactive.html`**: A single-page component with micro-interactions using Tailwind CSS for button hover effects.

## Features:

### Navigation Bar:
A responsive navigation bar across all pages, styled with Tailwind CSS. It includes links to common sections like "Home," "About," "Admissions," "Academics," and "Contact".

### Job Listings:
A table on the `index.html` page that lists fictional job opportunities. Each entry includes:
- Job title
- Company name
- Location
- Application deadline

### Photo Gallery:
The `gallery.html` page shows images in a flexible grid display that automatically resizes, considering the screen size of any given device. Each image has an alt text placeholder, hence making it easy to navigate through different devices in a bid to ensure continuity in user experience. This gallery is presenting visual contents in optimally set spacing that will not make screens appear cluttered, whether mobile or desktop.

### Interactive Landing Page:
The file `interactive.html` provides an attractive landing with entertaining micro-interactions. A hover effect over a button will smoothly change its background and scale the button, which creates a dynamic feeling of interaction. This will enhance user interaction by providing a sophisticated modern touch, which invites users to interact and visually underlines call-to-action elements.

## Setup Instructions:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the files in a web browser to preview the design.
3. Internet connection required to load Tailwind CSS from the CDN.

## Future Improvements

- Add a dynamic behavior to my page through JavaScript, for example, adding a carousel to the gallery or interactive filtering of jobs.
- Employ form handling in job applications and contact forms.
- Add more photos with captions and descriptive tags to the photo gallery.
