# Project overview
The aim of this project is the development of a personal profile depicting myself by way of background, education, skills, and key life experiences. I will be sharing my interests, taking the time to reflect on significant moments in my life, and outlining some future goals. In this manner, the profile shall outline the journey thus far and what I hope to become.

## Installation:


## Usage:
To access Figma, the user will go to [figma.com](https://figma.com) and log in with their account credentials. Once logged in, theyâ€™ll open the designated file from their dashboard. With the file open, the user can interact with the design, run inputs, and generate the output or preview they need.

In Figma, after logging in, the user will locate the specific file on their dashboard and open it to begin working. This allows them to access and edit the design as required. They can make changes, experiment with inputs, and instantly preview the results, making it easy to iterate on the design until they reach the desired outcome.

## Features:
1. Design and Code Handoff: Figma-to-developer handoffs are smoother since it does generate code snippets, provides CSS properties, and has direct export of design assets.
2. Auto Layout: Figma allows for easier responsive and adaptable designs, thanks to an intuitive layout system that will automatically adapt to screen size changes.
3. Component and Asset Libraries: Figma enables the designer to create reusable components of the design, like buttons and icons. They can then be put in libraries so that consistent designs can be used throughout a project.
4. Prototyping: Interactive prototyping is possible to build within Figa itself, where designers can add animation, transitions, and interaction to get an idea about the final product when it is in use.

## Technologies used:
1. Auto layout.
2. Frames
3. pem-tools
4. Text Style.
5. Prototyping.

## Ackmowledgement:
Getting such hands-on experiences has been a blessing; they really help in developing my creative thinking and instill confidence in me. These practical opportunities have enabled me to put into practice what I learned, think out of the box, and enhance my problem-solving capabilities. I am particularly grateful to my tutor because his commitment to making sure of such relevant and practical learning experiences has made a lasting difference in my development. It has further encouraged me to push beyond my boundaries, explore new ideas, and realize the essence of practical knowledge in shaping my future.
