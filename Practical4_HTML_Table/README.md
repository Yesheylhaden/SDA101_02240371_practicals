# SWE Class Time Table

## Overview
This project is an HTML-based class timetable that I've created to help manage my academic schedule in the Software Engineering (SWE) program. The timetable presents a clear weekly layout, making it easy for me to track my classes, including course codes, session types, and specific timings throughout the week. Each day is organized in a table format, detailing the classes I have at different times, which helps me plan my study sessions and stay on top of my commitments. This project serves as a vital tool for my organization and allows me to customize the timetable according to my specific course schedule and needs.

### Assignment Question

3. Table
Create an HTML page with a table representing your weekly course schedule (timetable). The table should include:

Days of the week as column headers (Monday to Friday)
Time slots as row headers (e.g., 9:00 AM-11:00 AM, etc.)

## Table Structure

The timetable is structured in a table format to provide a clear overview of my weekly academic schedule. It includes a **Days** column listing each day from Monday to Saturday. Following this, there are several **Time Slots** columns representing specific periods: 9-11am, 11-1pm, 1-3pm, and 3-4pm.

Each cell contains the course code and session type; for example, CSF101 L(DS) indicates a lecture for the **CSF101 course**. This organization allows me to easily navigate my week, understand my academic commitments, and effectively plan my study and assignment completion around my classes.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The timetable is displayed in a clean, responsive table format that is easy to read on various devices.
- **Clear Class Schedule**: The table outlines classes for each day of the week, including their respective time slots and types (Lecture, Practical, Tutorial).
- **Easy Modification**: Users can easily edit the HTML to customize the timetable according to their specific courses and schedules.

## Usage

1. **Open the HTML File**: Open the `index.html` file in any web browser to view the timetable.
2. **Customize the Schedule**: Modify the course names and timings directly in the HTML file to match your own schedule.
3. **Style Customization**: The linked CSS file (`course.css`) can be modified to enhance the visual appearance of the timetable.

## License
This project is specifically designed for my personal use to help manage my daily course schedule. It serves to keep track of my classes, assignments, and study sessions in one organized location, tailored to my unique academic needs. Since the content is customized to my specific courses and study habits, it is not suitable for public distribution or sharing, as it may not be relevant to others. Additionally, the schedule allows me to monitor and adapt to changes in my timetable, ensuring I stay organized and on top of my academic responsibilities.
