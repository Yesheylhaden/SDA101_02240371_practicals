### Reflection on Semester Assignment Grades

As I reflect on the process of creating the HTML document for my semester assignment grades, I realize how much I have learned and the challenges I encountered along the way.

## Main Concepts Applied:

1. **HTML Structure**: Understanding the fundamental structure of an HTML document was crucial. I learned how to properly use tags like `<head>`, `<body>`, `<table>`, and `<tr>` to organize content effectively.

2. **Table Creation**: I gained hands-on experience in creating tables, which are essential for displaying data in a clear and organized manner. This involved using `<th>` for headers and `<td>` for data cells, ensuring that the table was both informative and visually appealing.

3. **CSS Linking**: Although the CSS file (grade.css) wasn’t included in my reflection, linking stylesheets to an HTML document was a key learning point. It emphasized the importance of separating content from presentation, allowing for easier maintenance and a more professional look.

## Things Learned:

- **Data Representation**: I learned how to represent academic data effectively. Structuring grades, percentages, and corresponding grades in a table format helped me appreciate the importance of clarity when presenting information.

- **Attention to Detail**: Ensuring accuracy in the grades and percentages required careful attention. I learned the value of double-checking my data to avoid errors that could misrepresent my academic performance.

- **User Experience**: While working on this document, I thought about how users interact with information. A well-structured table enhances readability and makes it easier for readers to draw conclusions quickly.

## Challenges Faced:

One of the significant challenges I faced was ensuring that the table was responsive and visually appealing across different devices. Initially, the layout looked fine on my desktop, but it became cluttered when viewed on smaller screens. 

To overcome this, I researched responsive design principles and learned how to use CSS to adjust the table’s layout. This included using media queries to modify styles based on screen size, which greatly improved the user experience.

Another challenge was organizing the data meaningfully. I had to consider how best to display the grades in a way that would be easy for viewers to understand. After several iterations, I decided to categorize the modules and assignments clearly, which made a noticeable difference in the table's readability.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this exercise not only enhanced my technical skills in HTML and CSS but also taught me valuable lessons about data presentation and user experience. The challenges I encountered pushed me to seek solutions and refine my approach, ultimately leading to a final product that I am proud of. I look forward to applying these skills and lessons in future projects.
