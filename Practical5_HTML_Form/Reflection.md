### Main Concepts I Applied:
1. I used different input types for various labels, including:
   - **Text**: for Name, Email Address, and Password
   - **Date**: for Date of Birth
   - **Radio**: for Gender
   - **Number**: for Phone Number
   - **Time**: for Preferred Seminar Time
   - **Option**: for Meal Preference
   - **Submit**: for the Submit Button

### What I Learned:
I learned how to create a form using different input types effectively to meet various data collection needs.

### Challenges I Faced:
I encountered an issue with the radio inputs where all options could be selected at once, which wasn't the intended behavior. I overcame this challenge with the help of my Software Engineer Senior, Chimi Dorji, who identified and corrected the error for me.
